### Odd Sum Subsequence

You are given sequence *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>* of integer numbers of length *n*. Your task is to find such subsequence that its sum is odd and maximum among all such subsequences. 
It's guaranteed that given sequence contains subsequence with odd sum.

Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You should write a program which finds sum of the best subsequence.
